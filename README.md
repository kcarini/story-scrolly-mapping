# story-scrolly-mapping
List of platforms, libraries, etc... for map-centric storytelling apps 
I started this list based on a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/KiriCarini/status/1222196646957633537). I haven't used all these, but want a place to collect these resources. If you see something missing or want to add an example, please add or send me the info.

Some of these cost money, some are open source. Browse them all and see what meets your needs!
